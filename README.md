# DriveLog
Android UX design assignment for [Tampere University of Applied Sciences](http://www.tamk.fi/web/tamken).

The app it self is in proof of concept state and needs some work to be actually usable. The aim of this project was studying UX design and not making a finished product.

This is my second android project so there must be some silly things going on. The sqlite data binding needs work at least.

Theres a report on [making this app](DriveLog/AjoLoki_raportti.pdf) and my [learning process](DriveLog/Oppimispaivakirja.pdf) during the project. Both are in finnish.
